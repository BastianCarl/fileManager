JWS vs JWE

JWS = Json web signature
    content is visible
    content is Base64 encoded

JWE = Json web encryption
    content is not visible

HTTPS(SSL/TTL) requires both TrustStore and KeyStore

TrustStore(stores information about others)
    stores SSL certificates(self-signed and CA signed) of external trusted entities
    used during SSL handShake
    used for HTTP connections
    checks API's server certificate is trusted

KeyStore(stores information about us)
    vault used for storing private keys, certificates

HOW TO?
    Create a KeyStore
    Generate a SSL Certificate
    Import SSL Certificate to KeyStore
    Configure Tomcat to use it


The keystore is where you store your own private keys and certificates
The truststore contains certificates from other entities that you trust (typically from Certificate Authorities or trusted servers).
